        <h1>My teaching experience</h1>
        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>One year before i am a very shy guy and i let you know my english was lit bit weak.. let back to the topic one year before i am very very introvert type boy that no one wants to talk with me but today i am that guy who wouldn't go to college but whole the campus know who is umesh mehta.you wanna know how is this can so read this blog..</p>
        
        <h3>Lets start..</h3>
        <p>So at the time i passed out my 12th class where the journey starts i wont know what is coding what is programming and etc etc. my father's sister's son taught me to join a institute to learn c/c++ and i go to the bhawarkua this is very famous place for students who come outsite the city like we say that it is a mini kota in indore i saw a lot of institute that teach c/c++ literally i take a free demo class in every institute literally the number maybe 9-10. so i take admission in sk computer institute and learn c/c++.i don't why but whatever i learn ya whatever i do.. i do it from my heart (vo kehte hai na jo kro vo puri jee jaan laga ke kro) so i basically follow that rule and at the end ot c/c++ course the owner of the institute says that umesh will you teach students and i dont know why but i say sir i will answer this tommorrow because i was so nervous and at that time my age is just only 18.so i take permission from my parents and say yes. And that was my life's best decision that's the turning point of my life and then i take admission in college and when teacher teach c/c++ and ask's any question i would answer first and all the class was watching me like i am a alien.and then when i say i am a faculty in this institute all the students message me umesh please teach us c/c++ etc etc</p>
